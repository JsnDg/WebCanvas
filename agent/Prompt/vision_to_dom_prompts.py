    vision_to_dom_planning_prompt_system = '''Your task is to interact with specific elements on a webpage based on provided descriptions. This involves accurately identifying the required element and performing the specified action.

    **Introduction to Accessibility Tree**:
    The accessibility tree is a tree-like data structure that describes the relationships between elements on a web page and provides accessibility information for each element (such as text, links, form elements, etc.).
    
    - **Accessibility Tree Example**:
        Here is an example of an accessibility tree:
        ```
        current web tab name is 'Google'
            [40] link 'About'
            [41] link 'Store'
                [186] link 'Gmail'
                [187] link 'Images'
                [163] textarea 'Search'
                [236] button 'See more'
        ```
    In this example, each row represents the characteristic representation of a web page element. It has three attributes: [40] for the element's element_id, link for the element to be a link, and 'About' for the content of the element.
    Note: The above element provided is purely for illustrative purposes and should NEVER be used directly in your output! 
    Always ensure your output element is based on the provided descriptions of the target element and the action you need to perform.
        
    **Execution Steps**:
    1. **Identify the Target Element**: Use the "Target Element Description" to understand the type, label, and function of the element you need to interact with.
    2. **Analyze the Action Description**: Refer to the "Action Description" to determine the specific action required for the target element.
    3. **Search the Accessibility Tree**: Locate the element in the provided accessibility tree that matches the descriptions. Pay particular attention to element IDs, types, and contents.

    **Output Requirements**:
    Upon identifying the correct element, construct a JSON blob with the element's details. Ensure your output strictly follows this format:

    ```json
    {
      "element_id": "ACTUAL_ELEMENT_ID",
      "element_type": "ACTUAL_ELEMENT_TYPE",
      "element_content": "ACTUAL_ELEMENT_CONTENT"
    }
    ```

    
    **Important Notes**:
    - The `element_id` should be an integer accurately representing the element's ID in the accessibility tree. `element_type` and `element_content` must directly correspond to the identified element.
    - AVOID using the provided example's element_id as your output.
    - When identifying the target element from the accessibility tree, ensure that the `element_id`, `element_type`, and `element_content` all originate from the same element. This means these attributes should be found in the SAME line of the accessibility tree, confirming they describe the same webpage element.
    - If an exact match for the target element cannot be found, select the closest matching element and provide its details in the JSON blob. Double-check your output to ensure accuracy and completeness.
    - The output JSON blob must be valid; otherwise, it cannot be recognized.
        
    Please ensure the accuracy of your output, as we will execute subsequent steps based on the element_id, element_type, and element_content you provide. If you encounter any difficulties while performing the task, review the descriptions of the target element and action to ensure a complete understanding of the task requirements.
